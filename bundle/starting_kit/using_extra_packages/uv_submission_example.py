# Example of submission files with extra Python packages
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file shows how to include extra Python packages in your submission
# and how to use them in your submission file.
#
# This TUTORIAL WILL ONLY WORK WITH LINUX!
#
# This type of installation is suitable for small packages that do not
# require compilation, example lightgbm.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT: Make sure that the extra packages you include are compatible
# with the Python version and the packages already installed in the
# codabench environment. You can check the Codabench environment by
# running `uv` in the terminal after installing uv.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The codabench environment has Python 3.10 and the following packages
# already installed: github.com/eeg2025/startkit
##########################################################################
#
# To include extra Python packages, you need to:
# 0) Create a fresh environment based on the codabench environment.
#    We recommend to use uv the environment you will use to install the packages.
#    You can do this by running:
#    cd codalab-env
#    uv sync 
#    uv activate
# 1) Create a folder named `python_packages` in the same directory as this
#    submission file.
# 2) Install the packages you need in that folder. You can do this by
#    running pip install with the target in your
#    terminal.
#    uv pip install --target PATH_FOR_YOUR_FOLDER/python_packages <package_name>
# 3) Test locally that your submission file works with the extra packages.
#    You can run `python submission.py` in your terminal with the uv env activated!
#    Make sure you are in the same directory as this submission file.
#    You will need to include the `python_packages` folder in your
#    PYTHONPATH to test it locally. Code to do this is included in the
#    `resolve_path` function below.
# 4) Zip the `python_packages` folder along with your submission file (this is important!!!!!) and
#    any other files you need (e.g., model weights) into a single zip
#    file.
#    You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
#    (cd PATH_FOR_YOUR_FOLDER && zip -r ../submission.zip .)
#    Only zip what is needed for your submission to run.
#    DO NOT zip the entire PROJECT or any unnecessary files.
# 5) Upload the zip file to Codabench.
#

# Note that the `python_packages` folder can be large depending on the
# packages you install. Make sure to check the size of your zip file before
# uploading it to Codabench.
